**Vue Website Client Project**
These code files are segments of the Vue.js front-end website i built for a client. Due to confidentiality issues, I cannot upload the entire file, but below is a general overview of the user interface.
I created this website with heavy focus on how to deliver the information to the clients audience, as fast as possible with the simplest interface to adopt.
Hence this website has Microsoft SSO as a login barrier, then from there provides content filtering according to personel clearance.
