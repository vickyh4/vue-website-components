**Vue Website Client Project**

These code files are segments of the Vue.js front-end website i built for a client. Due to confidentiality issues, I cannot upload the entire file, but below is a general overview of the user interface.
I created this website with heavy focus on how to deliver the information to the clients audience, as fast as possible with the simplest interface to adopt.
